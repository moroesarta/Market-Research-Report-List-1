<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Two-dimensional Diagnostic Ultrasound Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fanshaped Scanning</li><li>Linear Scanning</li><li>Convex Array Scanning</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Two-dimensional diagnostic ultrasound devices can be categorized into three primary scanning types: fanshaped scanning, linear scanning, and convex array scanning. Fanshaped scanning utilizes a pie-shaped sector to capture broad areas, ideal for cardiac imaging. Linear scanning employs a straight transducer to provide high-resolution images of superficial structures, suitable for vascular and musculoskeletal imaging. Convex array scanning combines elements of both by using a curved transducer, offering a wider field of view for abdominal and obstetric applications while maintaining image clarity.</p></p>

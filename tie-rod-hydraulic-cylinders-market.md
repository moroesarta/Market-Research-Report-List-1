<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tie Rod Hydraulic Cylinders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-acting</li><li>Double-acting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Tie Rod Hydraulic Cylinders market is primarily categorized into single-acting and double-acting types. Single-acting cylinders utilize hydraulic pressure to extend the rod, relying on gravity or an external force for retraction, making them simple and cost-effective. In contrast, double-acting cylinders can move in both directions, utilizing hydraulic fluid to extend and retract, allowing for greater control and force. This versatility makes double-acting cylinders suitable for more demanding applications, while single-acting cylinders are often used in lighter-duty scenarios.</p></p>

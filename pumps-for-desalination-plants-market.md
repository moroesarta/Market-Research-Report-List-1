<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pumps for Desalination Plants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Pumps</li><li>Positive Displacement Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The desalination plants utilize two primary pump types: centrifugal pumps and positive displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps are commonly employed for their efficiency in handling large volumes of seawater, leveraging rotational energy to facilitate fluid movement. They are ideal for high flow rates but less effective with variable viscosity fluids. Positive displacement pumps, on the other hand, operate by trapping a fixed volume of fluid and forcing it through the discharge, making them suitable for applications requiring precise flow control and handling viscous fluids.</p></p>

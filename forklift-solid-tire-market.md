<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Forklift Solid Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cured-On Solid Tire</li><li>Pressed-On Solid Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The forklift solid tire market primarily consists of two types: cured-on solid tires and pressed-on solid tires. Cured-on solid tires are made by curing rubber on a steel casing, providing durability and resistance to punctures, making them ideal for heavy-duty applications. In contrast, pressed-on solid tires are made from a solid rubber compound that is pressed directly onto the wheel, offering a cost-effective solution for lighter loads. Both types enhance forklift performance while reducing maintenance in industrial settings.</p></p>
